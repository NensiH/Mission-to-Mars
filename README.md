# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview:
The purpose of this project was to build an APP to conduct web-scraping of MARS data and create an HTML page to show the results. Using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, the scraped data was stored in a Mongo database, and displayed in a re-designed web app using Flask to accommodate these images.

## Resources
**Data Sources:** [Mars News](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/?page=0&per_page=40&order=publish_date+desc%2Ccreated_at+desc&search=&category=19%2C165%2C184%2C204&blank_scope=Latest), [Mars Featured Images](https://spaceimages-mars.com/), [Mars Facts](https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/),[Mars Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars)

**Software:** Python, Jupyter Notebook, MongoDB , Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Flask, BootStrap 

## Results
**Scraping Mars Data**

By using, splinter and beautiful soup libraries to scrape the relevant data. Then, transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to the webpage using flask and used bootstrap to cleanup the webpage to make it presentable.
Here is the screenshot of the successfully created a page that displays the data collected and also mobile-responsive webpage:
