# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview:
The purpose of this project was to build an APP to conduct web-scraping of MARS data and create an HTML page to show the results. Using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, the scraped data was stored in a Mongo database, and displayed in a re-designed web app using Flask to accommodate these images.

## Results
**Scraping Mars Data**

By using, splinter and beautiful soup libraries we have scrape the relevant data in [Mission-to-Mars Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/NensiH/Mission-to-Mars/blob/main/mars_scraping/Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb). Then, Python to write the script in [scraping.py](https://github.com/NensiH/Mission-to-Mars/blob/main/mars_scraping/scraping.py) and transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to the webpage using flask in [app.py](https://github.com/NensiH/Mission-to-Mars/blob/main/mars_scraping/app.py) and at last, used bootstrap to cleanup the webpage to make it presentable in [index.html](https://github.com/NensiH/Mission-to-Mars/blob/main/mars_scraping/templates/index.html).

Here is the screenshot of the successfully created a page that displays the data collected and also mobile-responsive webpage:
